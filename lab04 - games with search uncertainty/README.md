# Chapter 5: Adversarial Search and Games

## Contents

### Defining a Game
* Example [Tic-Tac-Toe](tictactoe_definitions.ipynb)

### Connection to search with nondeterministic actions (from Chapter 4.3)
* Example: [Solving Tic-Tac-Toe with And-Or-Tree Search](tictactoe_and_or_tree_search.ipynb). Here the opponent is seen as part of the environment, i.e.,
each action by the player is followed by an unknown action of the opponent which, from the viewpoint of the player makes the outcomes of actions nondeterministic.

### Solving games using adversarial search
* Example: [Solving Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax Search and Alpha-Beta Pruning](tictactoe_alpha_beta_tree_search.ipynb)
* Example: [Solving Tic-Tac-Toe with Heuristic Alpha-Beta Tree Search](tictactoe_heuristic_alpha_beta_tree_search.ipynb)
* Example: [Solving Tic-Tac-Toe with Pure Monte Carlo Search](tictactoe_pure_monte_carlo_search.ipynb)
* Example: [Solving Tic-Tac-Toe with Pure Monte Carlo Search + UCB1 Selection Policy](tictactoe_monte_carlo_tree_search_restricted.ipynb)

### Interactive game play
* Example: [Play Tic-Tac-Toe Interactively (Simple Implementation)](tictactoe_interactive.ipynb)
